                    The following information will be deleted from our database under the conditions listed below:
                </p>
                <ul>

            <div class="container">
                <h1>Feedback Plan</h1>
                <hr />
                <h2>Feedback Plan sec. i) Asking for Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    A feedback survey database on the local device will contain about 20 possible questions and templates. At the end of each week (in a weekly reflection style), 3-4 of the database questions will be asked (or modified and asked) randomly towards the user to gather usability data and application or personal improvement data. Application improvement feedback questions will always be available to answer via Settings tab. By submitting the survey, the user consents to the data collection involved with the questions they answered. Data collection will be used to analyze the effectiveness of the app and further improve its usability and methods.
                </p>
                <h2>Feedback Plan sec. ii) Categorizing the Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    Of the 20 questions, they will be categorized as either Personal Improvement, Application Feedback, or Application Request. All the questions will be associated with the unnamed user data for analytical purposes. The answers will be organized into a user-specific spreadsheet available to researchers or developers (ie. The developers will not have access to personal improvement answers)
                </p>
                <h2>Feedback Plan sec. iii) Acting on the Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    Application Feedback and Application Request data will be implemented in regular update intervals, likely on a bi-weekly to monthly basis. Personal Improvement data will be used to improve the effectiveness of the application and further research and improve methods used. The Personal Improvement data will also be used to provide a custom approach to users after review of researchers and psychologists.
                </p>
                <h2>Feedback Plan sec. iv) Following Up on the Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    Users will be thanked after filling out all feedback forms. In the case that users chose to fill out forms via Settings, they will be emailed or sent a personal notification with a reply based on the requests or feedback they sent. Personal replies can either thank the user and ask for related positive comments or inquire as to why the user said something negative and fix the issue in a professional and respectful way to improve the experience for others using the application.
